# Project-demos

Here are example projects from my journey in Aalto University:

**CN_project_EO.pdf** = pdf file containing individually completed network analysis project simulating infection spreading. Done for the course "Complex Networks" in fall 2021. From this project work, I earned full points. 

**CN_project.ipynb** = Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the complex networks project. In this file, I have done the part beginning from the "Begin of the exercise".

**DC_analysis.ipynb** = Jupyter Notebook containing the Data analysis project done in collaboration with Ilmari Lehtinen for the course "Basics of Biomedical Data Analysis". In the project work, we analyzed hospital data to predict the survival of the patient and compared different classifiers.

**AI in Healthtech project.ipynb** = Jupyter Notebook containing the Brain Tumor Segmentation project done Fall 2023 for the course "AI in Health Technologies". This project has been done in collaboration with Tuomas Laiho and Jesse Viljanen.
